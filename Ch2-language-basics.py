# In Python, implicit casts are not allowed

"5" + 5 # throws a type error

# every object has a specific type (or class), and implicit 
# conversions will occur only in certain permitted circumstances
# such as:
    
a = 4.5

b = 2

a / b # yields the float 2.25


# checking that an object is an instance of a particular type

# objects have attributes and methods

# attributes and methods via the getattr function:
